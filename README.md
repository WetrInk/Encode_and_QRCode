# Encode_and_QRCode

Two modules are needed: qrcode & PIL

batch may be needed:
  pip install pillow
  pip install qrcode[pil]


Unfortunately, though this script works well when call "python encode.py" in Powershell,
it can't be normally run in VS Code as module importing failure.(I tried but it still doesn't work.)

More Debugging & Experience is needed :)
